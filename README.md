# picklemp
PickleMP is a Godot asset for serializing arbitrary godot data structures, 
including custom classes, over multiplayer and to disk.


# TODO
+ verify we can pickle to and from bytes
- do I need to pickle to a file?
- do I need to pickle to json?
- should I enforce that dictionary keys should only be either strings or integers?
